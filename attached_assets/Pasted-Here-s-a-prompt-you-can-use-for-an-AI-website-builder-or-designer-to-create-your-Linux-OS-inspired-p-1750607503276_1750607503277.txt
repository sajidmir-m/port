Here’s a prompt you can use for an AI website builder or designer to create your Linux OS-inspired portfolio, including your mobile number and email:

Design a personal portfolio website for Sajid Nazir, styled to look like a Linux desktop environment. The homepage should resemble a Linux OS desktop, with a taskbar, desktop wallpaper, and draggable/resizable folder windows. Each folder window represents a section of my portfolio:

- “My Projects”: Detailed write-ups for projects including:
  - AI-Based Airport Baggage and Passenger Flow (AI-driven system for optimizing baggage handling and passenger flow)
  - OSINT-Based Threat Profiling & Reconnaissance Framework (automation tool for cyber threat intelligence)
  - Hexacopter-Based Firefighting Drone (low-cost drone prototype for fire response)
- “About Me”: My profile, education (B.E. in Computer Science, MVJ College of Engineering; Diploma in Computer Science, Kashmir Govt Polytechnic), skills (Web Development, AI/ML, IoT, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Python, Public Relations, Leadership, Communication, Critical Thinking, Time Management), and a short personal statement about my passion for tech and innovation.
- “Contact”: Clearly display my phone number (9149559393), email (mirsajidd7@gmail.com), LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sajid-mir-508895314/7), and location (Whitefield, Bengaluru, India, 560067).
- “Achievements”: Highlight awards like the Shining Star Award from CT University, Google Developer Groups membership, and sports medals.
- “Hobbies”: Gym, sports, cooking, travelling, singing, building projects, and learning new tech.

Each folder should open in a window with Linux-style UI elements (close, minimize, maximize). Use Linux-inspired icons and color schemes (like Ubuntu or Mint). Make the site responsive and interactive, giving users the feeling of using a Linux desktop. Add my photo or avatar on the desktop, and a “Terminal” window that greets visitors or summarizes my skills.
